- **Infobox**: A section providing concise and informative details about the website or specific anime series.
- **Airing Animes**: Color bars are used to indicate the status of each anime, such as orange/yellow for translating, red/red-orange for unknown, and green for completed series. Text on the color bars provides further context and information.
